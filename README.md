# Machine-Assisted-Rehabilitation-of-Knee-Osteoarthritis-MARKO-

• A bio-inspired solution for Rehabilitation of patients suﬀering from Knee Osteoarthritis
• Project Objective: Automate both stages of rehabilitation (i.e.)
Stage 1 (THERAPY): To gain control over the knees,
Stage 2 (TRAINING): To strengthen the muscles around the knees,
Integrate them in the same machine and make the recovery process interesting and motivating by interfacing stage 2 with a gaming context. For stage 1, a four-bar linkage slider-crank mechanism assists the leg, performing physiotherapy in a CPM with the help of a linear Motor driven slider. For stage 2, EMG signals are taken from the patient’s thigh muscles to detect the intent and direction in which the person puts the effort to move his/her leg and a rotary encoder is used to measure the distance moved by the leg, which is fed as parameters of control for the game, allowing the person to train his leg while gaming.
• Fabricated an efficient design, based on minimum force on knee joint and cost effective Continuous passive Motion (CPM) machine
• Processed Electromyograph signals from Thigh muscles, the Hamstrings and quadriceps and used Machine Learning algorithm to set the threshold parameter to classify muscle intent signals.
• Designed a basic game using Blender software, which will be controlled using the EMG and the encoder data
